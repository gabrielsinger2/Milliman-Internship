# Milliman-Internship
Here are a few words about my internship as a quant. 
During this internship I developed an automatic investment strategy, here in the form of a machine learning algorithm, capable of taking advantage of climate data to beat the market.  In particular, I developed a closed formula capable of "understanding" the data in a market context.

The devellopped strategy beat the market (and two state-of-the-art algorithms) in both the historical and monte carlo backtests. 

I also participated in the development of the backtesting pipeline, implementing for example new state-of-the-art metrics related to climate and investment, as well as proposing a new evaluation method for this type of strategy. 

A big thank you to my superiors who gave me infinite freedom of research!
